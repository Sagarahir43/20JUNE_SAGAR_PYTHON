Many-to-Many Relationship: A "Course" can have multiple faculty members who teach it, 
and a faculty member can teach multiple courses. This is a classic many-to-many relationship.

Intermediary Entity: To model this relationship, you would often introduce an intermediary entity to connect 
the "Course" and "Faculty" entities. This entity stores additional information about the teaching assignment, 
such as the semester, year, workload distribution, etc.

Here's how the entities and their relationships might be structured:

Course: Contains information about a specific academic course.

Attributes: course_id, course_name, course_description, etc.
Faculty: Represents a faculty member.

Attributes: faculty_id, faculty_name, faculty_email, etc.
TeachingAssignment: The intermediary entity that represents the assignment of a faculty member to a specific course.

Attributes: assignment_id, course_id (foreign key referencing Course), faculty_id (foreign key referencing Faculty), 
semester, year, workload_percentage, etc.
