Generating Translation Message Files:
When you develop a Django project, you often include text in your code and 
that you want to make available for translation into different languages. 
These text strings are referred to as "translation strings." The make messages 
command scans your project's source code and templates to identify these strings and creates 
or updates a .po (Portable Object) file for each language you want to support. Each .po file contains 
the original text and a placeholder for the translated text.

Collecting Translation Strings:
The make messages command collects the translation strings from various parts 
of your project, including Python code (using the gettext function or its aliases) and templates 
(using the {% trans %} template tag). It also scans for other translation-related functions and tags, 
such as ugettext, pgettext, and blocktrans.

Updating Existing Translation Files:
If you've already created translation message files, running make messages will 
update these files with any new or modified translation strings in your project. This ensures 
that the translation files stay up-to-date as your project evolves.

Multiple Languages:
You can specify which languages you want to generate or update translation 
message files for by providing the language code as an argument to the make 
messages command. For example:
