Create a Django Project:
If you haven't already, create a Django project 
by running the following command:

django-admin startproject projectname
Create a Django App:
Next, create a Django app within your 
project by running the following command:

python manage.py startapp myapp
Define a View:
In your app's views.py file, define a view function. This function will be 
responsible for rendering content when a specific URL is accessed. Here's a 
simple example:

from django.http import HttpResponse

def hello(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, Django!")

Create a URL Pattern:
In your app's urls.py file (if it doesn't exist, create it), define a URL pattern. 
This URL pattern will associate a URL with the hello view function you created. Here's an example 
of a URL pattern definition:

from django.urls import path
from . import views  # Import the views module from your app

urlpatterns = [
    path('hello/', views.hello, name='hello_view'),
]
In this example, the URL pattern associates the URL path 'hello/' 
with the hello view function.

Include the App's URLs in the Project:
To make the URL patterns of your app available to the project, you need to include your 
app's URLs in the project's urls.py file. In the project's urls.py file, add an include statement 
and specify the URL patterns from your app:

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include  # Import the include function

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('myapp/', include('myapp.urls')),  # Include the app's URLs
]
In this example, all URLs starting with 'myapp/' will be handled by the URL patterns defined in your app's urls.py file.
