How can you pick a random item from a list or tuple?
To pick a random item from a list or tuple in Python, 
you can use the `random` module, which provides various functions for generating random numbers and making random selections. 
Here's how you can do it:

1. Import the `random` module at the beginning of your script:
   python
   import random
   

2. To pick a random item from a list, you can use the `random.choice()` function. 
   Pass the list as an argument to the function, and it will return a randomly selected item from the list:
   python
   my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   random_item = random.choice(my_list)
   

3. To pick a random item from a tuple, you can first convert the tuple to a list using the `list()` function, 
   and then use the `random.choice()` function as mentioned above:
   python
   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
   random_item = random.choice(list(my_tuple))
   

After executing the above code snippets, the variable `random_item` will contain a randomly selected item from the list or tuple.

Note: The `random.choice()` function returns a random item with equal probability. If you want to make multiple random
