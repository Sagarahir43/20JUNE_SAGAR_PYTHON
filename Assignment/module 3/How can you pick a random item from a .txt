How can you pick a random item from a range?
To pick a random item from a range in Python, you can use the `random` module. Here's how you can do it:

1. Import the `random` module at the beginning of your script:
   python
   import random
   

2. Use the `random.choice()` function to pick a random item from the range. Pass the range as an argument to the function, 
   and it will return a randomly selected item from the range:
   python
   my_range = range(1, 10)
   random_item = random.choice(my_range)
   

After executing the above code snippet, the variable `random_item` will contain a randomly selected item from the specified range.

Note: In Python, the `range()` function creates a sequence of numbers within a specified range. The range is defined by the start and stop values, 
      and it generates numbers up to, but not including, the stop value. 
      The `random.choice()` function can be used to randomly select an item from any iterable, including a range.

If you want to pick multiple random items from a range without replacement (i.e., without picking the same item again), 
you can use the `random.sample()` function instead.
