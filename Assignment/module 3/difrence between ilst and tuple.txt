What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple.
A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of elements in Python. 
It is similar to a list, but the main difference is that tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified once created. 
Here are the key differences between lists and tuples:

1. Mutability: Lists are mutable, which means you can add, remove, or modify elements after the list is created. 
               Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable, and their elements cannot be changed after creation.

2. Syntax: Lists are defined using square brackets `[ ]`, while tuples are defined using parentheses `( )`. For example:
   - List: `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`
   - Tuple: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`

3. Modification: Since tuples are immutable, you cannot add or remove elements from a tuple, nor can you modify existing elements. 
                 In contrast, lists allow you to append or remove elements using methods like `append()`, `remove()`, 
                 or by directly assigning new values to specific indices.

4. Use cases: Lists are commonly used for storing collections of related items that may need to be modified, such as a list of tasks, 
              a shopping list, or a sequence of numbers. 
              Tuples are often used when you want to group related values together, but you don't want them to be modified accidentally. Tuples are useful for returning multiple values from a function, as dictionary keys (since they are immutable), or for representing fixed collections of data, such as coordinates or dimensions.

5. Performance: Since tuples are immutable, they are more memory-efficient and faster to access than lists. 
                However, when it comes to modifying or iterating over elements, lists are generally faster.

In summary, the main difference between lists and tuples is that lists are mutable, while tuples are immutable. 
Lists allow modifications to their elements and have a more flexible nature,
whereas tuples provide an immutable and efficient way to group related values together.
